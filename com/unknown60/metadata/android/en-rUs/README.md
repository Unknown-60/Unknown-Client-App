### About

**Unknown Client** It's an open source project developed at the end of **2014**. At the beginning of its development it was a closed source project, and by choosing to make it a small size application, the **obfuscation** of resources was omitted. Making malicious people **steal** part of the Unknown Client code logic.

Thanks to this, as a developer, **I lost the desire** to continue with the project.

To this day, seeing that the applications with the stolen code have few functions, do not have support for new versions of android and that they are also full of errors, I decided to update and publish the source code.

### Downloads

At the moment you can download the compiled and signed project from github.
